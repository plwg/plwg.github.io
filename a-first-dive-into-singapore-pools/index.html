        <h1>A First Dive into Singapore Pools</h1>

    </header><p>Lotteries have long been called a &ldquo;tax on the stupid&rdquo;. While I
sympathize with this gross characterization, I do think it left some
interesting questions unasked:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which lottery game is better among others?</li>
<li>Is the lottery truly unbeatable?</li>
<li>Is there a way to improve expected value of winning?</li>
</ol>
<p>To answer these questions, we must first quantify the &ldquo;stupidity&rdquo; of
lotteries. In this post, we aim to do just that within the context of
Singapore&rsquo;s lottery games, utilizing principles of probability
analysis. <strong>Rather than accepting the invincibility of the lottery
system as a given, we roll up our sleeves and take a deeper look.</strong>
Sometimes, as the saying goes, we may just find a real $100 note lying
on the ground waiting to be picked up. Our motivation for this
exercise is partly drawn from the story of a group of punters who
managed to beat the Massachusetts state lottery in 2005, as recounted
in Jordan Ellenberg&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How%5FNot%5Fto%5FBe%5FWrong">book</a>.</p>
<p>All information followed is up-to-date as of 2023-04-26. The
information is not intended to be and do not constitute financial
advice, investment advice, trading advice or any other advice.</p>
<h2 id="lay-of-the-land">Lay of the Land</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore%5FPools">Singapore Pools</a>, the sole perator legally allowed to run lotteries in
the city state, offers three games currenly. Ranked by popularity,
they are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Digits">4D</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toto%5F(lottery)">TOTO</a></li>
<li>Singapore Sweep</li>
</ol>
<p>We will tackle 4D and Singapore Sweep first. The reason is that they
both have fixed prizes, which makes the analysis straightforward.
TOTO, with its variable jackpot and more complex mechanism, warrants
closer scrutiny separately.</p>
<h2 id="singapore-sweep">Singapore Sweep</h2>
<p>The rules can be found <a href="https://online.singaporepools.com/en/lottery/how-play-singapore-sweep">here</a>.</p>
<p>Overall the goal is to pick a number from 1000000 to 4499999 (both
inclusive) that matches drawn numbers in the same range. Each pick
costs S$3. There are 133 draws with various prizes, ranging from
S$2.3M to S$1,000. If a number wins multiple prizes, it is entitled to
all of them, and multiple winners do not split prizes. Additionally, a
separate mini prize is awarded if the last two digits match with one
of the nine sets of draw two digit number.</p>
<p>Since all the draws are independent, we can calculate their expected
value (EV) and add them up. Here is a table summarizing the results:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Prize</th>
<th>Prob</th>
<th>Number of Price</th>
<th>EV</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>$2,300,000</td>
<td>0.00003%</td>

</table>
<p>From this table, it&rsquo;s clear that playing the Singapore Sweep is not a
wise financial decision. With an expected loss of 49.6% for every S$3
spent, players are not likely to come out ahead.</p>
<h2 id="4d">4D</h2>
<p>The rules can be found <a href="https://www.singaporepools.com.sg/en/rules/Pages/4d-game-rules-general.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Overall the goal is to pick a number from 0000 to 9999 (both
inclusive) that matches drawn numbers in the same range. Each pick
costs S$1. There are 23 draws with various prizes, ranging from
S$3,000 to S$60. If a number wins multiple prizes, it is entitled to
all of them, and multiple winners do not split prizes.</p>
<p>An interesting mechanism for 4D is that better can choose from two
types of play: big bet or small bet. Big bet has more winning
combinations but less prize money, ranging from S$2,000 to S$60; the
opposite is true for small bet, with prize money ranging from S$3,000
to S$800. This means that when calculating EVs, two tables need to be
drawn, as followed:</p>
<p>Big bet</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Prize</th>
<th>Prob</th>
<th>Number of Winning Combination</th>
<th>EV</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>$2,000</td>
<td>0.01%</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>$0.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$1,000</td>
<td>0.01%</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>$0.10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$490</td>
<td>0.01%</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>$0.05</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$250</td>
<td>0.01%</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>$0.25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$60</td>
<td>0.01%</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>$0.06</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>Total</td>
<td>$0.66</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Small bet</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Prize</th>
<th>Prob</th>
<th>Number of Winning Combination</th>
<th>EV</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>$3,000</td>
<td>0.01%</td>

<td>$0.30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$2,000</td>
<td>0.01%</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>$0.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$800</td>
<td>0.01%</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>$0.08</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>Total</td>
<td>$0.58</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Again, from these tables, it is clear that playing 4D, big or small,
is not a wise financial decision. The less bad of the two is big bet,
with an expected loss of 34%. Assuming the player is indifferent to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility">utility</a>, the small bet is strictly worse than the big bet.</p>
<h2 id="counterparty-risk">Counterparty Risk</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Counterparty risk is the likelihood or probability that one of those
involved in a transaction might default on its contractual obligation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Singapore Sweep and 4D, the prizes are not split in case of
multiple winners. Left unmitigated, this means that the lottery operator
can face uncapped loss if there are multiple winning tickets. Is there
a tail risk that the operator cannot pay out the price?</p>
<p>No for 4D. In the case of the two games, the operator mitigated the
risk by reserving the right to <a href="https://www.singaporepools.com.sg/en/services/Pages/%5Farchives/placing-4D-bets-at-outlets.html">declare a combination &ldquo;sold out&rdquo;</a> for
4D:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We may be unable to accept your bet if the number has reached its
sales limit for that draw.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for Singapore Sweep, punter <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/punters-will-soon-be-able-to-choose-singapore-sweep-numbers">cannot freely choose</a> her combination:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new selection formats allow players to choose either the first or
last four digits of their set of numbers, but not both. Every ticket
has a seven-digit number.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Singapore Pools is also introducing another new selection format
called the &ldquo;100 Sweep&rdquo; that will allow punters to buy 100 sets of
numbers in running sequence, with the last two digits ranging from 00
to 99. This will be printed on just one ticket slip.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second option, 100 Sweep, <a href="https://online.singaporepools.com/en/lottery/how-play-singapore-sweep">is no longer offered</a> as of April
23, 2023.</p>
<p>By giving limited flexibility when choosing the combination, the
operator prevents the same combination from being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overselling">oversold</a>,
effectively curtailing its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%5Fswan%5Ftheory">tail risk</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we delved into two of the three lottery games legally
offered in Singapore and found that they are both losing propositions
mathematically. To answer the questions we set out to investigate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which lottery game is better among others?
<ul>
<li>4D big bet is the least bad among the three (Sweep, 4D big, 4D
small). One is <strong>only</strong> expected to lose 34c per dollar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is the lottery truly unbeatable?
<ul>
<li>Yes. These two fixed-prize games both have negative EV, meaning
that one is guaranteed to lose money in the long term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there a way to improve expected value of winning?
<ul>
<li>No. There is no way to game them by structuring bet. There is no
strategy element.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, in this case, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market%5Fhypothesis">there is no free money lying on the ground</a>. In
the next post we will continue our journey and investigate the last
game in town - TOTO. Stay tuned for a dive into the deep end of
Singapore Pools.</p>
