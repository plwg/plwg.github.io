        <h1>Intellectual Escape Velocity</h1>

    </header><p>In physics, the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape%5Fvelocity">escape velocity</a> refers to &ldquo;the minimum speed
needed for a free, non-propelled object to escape from the
gravitational influence of a primary body, thus reaching an infinite
distance from it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Actually, escape velocity is an umbrella term for so called cosmic
velocities. The first four cosmic velocities are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To escape earth&rsquo;s surface and reach orbit: 7.9 km/s</li>
<li>&hellip; earth&rsquo;s gravitational pull: 11.2 km/s</li>
<li>&hellip; sun&rsquo;s gravitational pull: 16.7 km/s</li>
<li>&hellip; Milky Way&rsquo;s gravitational pull: 525 km/s</li>
</ol>
<p>For me, the idea of escape velocity is fascinating because it is
binary - going faster than it, you are free; going slower than it, you
are forever bound to the object pulling you. It is similar to the idea
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticality%5F(status)">criticality</a> in nuclear physics, which refers to the state that,
once reached, the chain reaction can remain self-sustaining.</p>
<p>It is also fascinating as a model applying to the act of thinking.
Similar to an intergalactic probe flying faster than escape velocity
to evade the pull of cosmic bodies, a person aspired to think freely
cannot stay intellectually stagnant, because there exists various
school of thought that exhibit strong intellectual attraction. They
will pull one into their orbits. And once captured, unless enough
reflection was done against the prevailing wisdom, one is no longer
free. It is better to evade capture in the first place. I feel that
this characteristic explains why otherwise smart people fall under the
influence of cults. Their existing intellectual velocity was below the
necessary escape velocity. Drawn in, they end up becoming part of
those bodies, adding to their mass, and waiting to pull down the next
drifting voyager.</p>
<p>In fact, this is why one has to think even more critically when
approaching a prominent school of thoughts (akin to apply a countering
force opposite the direction of the gravitational pull), because the
latter&rsquo;s mass, both inherent and added to by those already claimed by
its gravitation, is powerful. This explains why madness of crowds
often grow at a frenzy pace as it approaches the end - it is pulling
everything into its orbit, and the resulting mass in turns more things
into its orbit.</p>
<p>Another phenomenon that I think the model of escape velocity applies
to is that of personal enlightenment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone at birth starts with an initial velocity of zero, but has
different innate ability when its comes to acceleration, i.e., the
ability to learn.</li>
<li>Upbringing/family/environment determines the escape velocity
required, i.e., how much one has to learn in order to move away
from his starting point.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these, one reaches the sobering conclusion that, not everyone
will be able to go far from where he started. Some people were born
into families that pull them downward with great force; some failed to
learn; some learn, but not fast enough as the adversity is also
getting stronger; some were in an environment that simply does not
have the material to provide the acceleration. It takes all - constant
effort, aptitude and the right education - to transcend one&rsquo;s
upbringing.</p>
<p>No matter what it is still worthwhile to try to reach escape velocity.
Though not everyone will chart a course into infinity, perhaps it is
still viable to reach orbit, and that would be a better starting point
for the next generation.</p>
