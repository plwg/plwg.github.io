    </header><p>In gambling, a Dutch book is a set of odds and bets, established by the
bookmaker, that ensures a profit for the bookmaker at the expense of
the gamblers, regardless of the outcome of the event being bet on.
This concept is associated with probabilities implied by the odds not
being coherent.</p>
<p>However, in a prediction market, Dutch book opportunities arise due to
inconsistencies in the probabilities assigned to various outcomes,
which can occur when the market is still nascent or when a big trade
moves the odds significantly. It is not monopolized by the bookmaker.
It is up to arbitrage traders to pick up these opportunities, profit
from them, and in the process, eliminate the mispricing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore two examples of Dutch books:</p>
<h2 id="rain-or-no-rain">Rain or No Rain</h2>
<p>Consider the question, &ldquo;Will it rain tomorrow?&rdquo; and assume that the
following odds are being offered in two different markets:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Outcomes</th>
<th>Decimal Odds</th>
<th>Implied Probabilities</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Rain</td>
<td>1.538</td>
<td>0.65</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No Rain</td>
<td>2.381</td>
<td>0.42</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Outcomes</th>
<th>Decimal Odds</th>
<th>Implied Probabilities</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Rain</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>0.33</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No Rain</td>
<td>1.333</td>
<td>0.75</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Individually, the odds in both markets are too expensive and cannot be
Dutch booked. However, there is a Dutch book here if we consider them
together. The probabilities of no rain and rain add up to less than 1.
This violates the axiom of probability.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s trade them with the following step:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy $33 worth of &ldquo;Rain&rdquo; in the second market</li>
<li>Buy $42 worth of &ldquo;No Rain&rdquo; in the first market</li>
</ul>
<p>With a total cost of $75, this set of bets is guaranteed to yield $100
regardless of the outcome, earning a 33% risk-free return.</p>
<h2 id="incoherent-preference">Incoherent Preference</h2>
<p>Consider the following market:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Outcomes</th>
<th>Yes Probability</th>
<th>No Probability</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Rain</td>
<td>0.06</td>
<td>0.94</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rain and Snow</td>
<td>0.10</td>
<td>0.90</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These probabilities are incoherent because the probability of &ldquo;Rain&rdquo;
should always be equal to or greater than the probability of &ldquo;Rain and
Snow&rdquo;. Interestingly, identifying the incoherence does not require us
to know the true probabilities of the weather events; we only need to
notice that inequality is in the wrong direction. Question is, how can
one profit from this without risk?</p>
<p>We start by noticing that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pr(Rain) is currently under-priced</li>
<li>Pr(Rain and Snow) is currently over-priced</li>
</ol>
<p>Knowing that arbitraging would correct the mispricing, we can try to
push things at that direction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy 100 &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; shares for &ldquo;Rain&rdquo;, for $6</li>
<li>Buy 100 &ldquo;No&rdquo; shares for &ldquo;Rain and Snow&rdquo;, for $90</li>
</ol>
<p>The possible outcomes are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Outcome</th>
<th>Cost</th>
<th>Payoff</th>
<th>Profit</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Rain and No Snow</td>
<td>96</td>
<td>200</td>
<td>104</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rain and Snow</td>
<td>96</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No Rain and No Snow</td>
<td>96</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No Rain and Snow</td>
<td>96</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Not bad, with this Dutch Book, we will always be able to pocket $4
when the bet settles, and even have a chance of netting $104!</p>
<p>In conclusion, Dutch books in prediction markets are a result of
inconsistent probabilities assigned to different outcomes, often
across markets. This inconsistency presents a window of opportunity
for arbitrage traders who can take advantage of the situation to make
risk-free profits by buying and selling in multiple markets. Despite
the complexities involved, such as the need to lock up funds in
multiple markets and regulatory hurdles, Dutch book opportunities are
straight-forward to spot using the axioms of probability. In
prediction market, the liquidity should flow between markets until the
implied probabilities are coherent.</p>
