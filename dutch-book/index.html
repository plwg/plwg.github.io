    </header><p>Gambling and prediction markets are known to produce a wide range of
probabilities that may not always align with reality. In gambling,
this can lead to the bookmaker benefiting at the expense of the
gambler, regardless of the outcome. However, in prediction markets,
these inconsistencies can offer an opportunity for arbitrage traders
to generate risk-free profits. This is known as a Dutch book, and it
arises when inconsistent probabilities assigned to different outcomes
across markets are exploited.</p>
<p>A Dutch book can emerge in several ways. For instance, the market may
still be in its early stages or a major trade may shift the odds
significantly, leading to a mispricing. When this occurs, arbitrage
traders can buy and sell in multiple markets to lock in a profit,
thereby eliminating the mispricing. While this process may be complex
due to regulatory barriers and the need to lock up funds in multiple
markets, Dutch book opportunities are often short-lived, as the market
tends to correct itself quickly once mispricing is detected.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore two examples of Dutch books:</p>
<h2 id="rain-or-no-rain">Rain or No Rain</h2>
<p>Consider the question, &ldquo;Will it rain tomorrow?&rdquo; and assume that the
following odds are being offered in two different markets:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Outcomes</th>
<th>Decimal Odds</th>
<th>Implied Probabilities</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Rain</td>
<td>1.538</td>
<td>0.65</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No Rain</td>
<td>2.381</td>
<td>0.42</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Outcomes</th>
<th>Decimal Odds</th>
<th>Implied Probabilities</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Rain</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>0.33</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No Rain</td>
<td>1.333</td>
<td>0.75</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Individually, the odds in both markets are too expensive and cannot be
Dutch booked. However, there is a Dutch book here if we consider them
together. The probabilities of no rain and rain add up to less than 1.
This violates the axiom of probability.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s trade them with the following step:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy $33 worth of &ldquo;Rain&rdquo; in the second market</li>
<li>Buy $42 worth of &ldquo;No Rain&rdquo; in the first market</li>
</ul>
<p>With a total cost of $75, this set of bets is guaranteed to yield $100
regardless of the outcome, earning a 33% risk-free return.</p>
<h2 id="incoherent-preference">Incoherent Preference</h2>
<p>Consider the following market:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Outcomes</th>
<th>Yes Probability</th>
<th>No Probability</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Rain</td>
<td>0.06</td>
<td>0.94</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rain and Snow</td>
<td>0.10</td>
<td>0.90</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These probabilities are incoherent because the probability of &ldquo;Rain&rdquo;
should always be equal to or greater than the probability of &ldquo;Rain and
Snow&rdquo;. While we don&rsquo;t need to know the true probabilities of the
weather events to identify this inconsistency, it is enough to
recognize that the inequality is in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Knowing that arbitraging would correct the mispricing, we can guess
that the risk free trade is pushing things at that direction with
proportion to the probabilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy 100 &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; shares for &ldquo;Rain&rdquo;, for $6</li>
<li>Buy 100 &ldquo;No&rdquo; shares for &ldquo;Rain and Snow&rdquo;, for $90</li>
</ol>
<p>The possible outcomes are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Outcome</th>
<th>Cost</th>
<th>Payoff</th>
<th>Profit</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Rain and No Snow</td>
<td>96</td>
<td>200</td>
<td>104</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rain and Snow</td>
<td>96</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No Rain and No Snow</td>
<td>96</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No Rain and Snow</td>
<td>96</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>With this Dutch Book, we will always be able to pocket $4 when the bet
settles, and even have a chance of netting $104.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Dutch books in prediction markets are a result of
inconsistent probabilities assigned to different outcomes, often
across markets. This inconsistency presents a window of opportunity
for arbitrage traders who can take advantage of the situation to make
risk-free profits by buying and selling in multiple markets. Despite
the complexities involved, such as the need to lock up funds in
multiple markets and regulatory hurdles, Dutch book opportunities are
straight-forward to spot using the axioms of probability. As
prediction markets continue to grow and mature, these opportunities
may become scarcer, but for now, the astute trader can profit from
them and help steer market towards coherency.</p>
