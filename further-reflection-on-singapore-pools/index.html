    </header><p><a href="https://plwg.github.io/a-first-dive-into-singapore-pools/">Previously</a>, your faithful correspondent investigated two lottery
games, 4D and Sweep, offered by Singapore Pools. The remaining one,
TOTO, is more complex and thus deserves separate treatment. This
article is that treatment. It aims to answer the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can TOTO be beaten? Is there a way to improve expected values of
winning?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All information that follows is up-to-date as of 2023-05-30. The

presented for entertainment only. While I tried my best to present
correct information, I might still be wrong. Please act wisely.</p>
<h2 id="the-game-and-its-players">The Game and its Players</h2>
<p>The rule of TOTO can be found <a href="https://www.singaporepools.com.sg/en/rules/Pages/toto-game-rules-general.html">here</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Below
is my attempt at capturing it using a system diagram:</p>
<figure><img src="/ox-hugo/toto.png"
         alt="Figure 1: An Overview of TOTO"/><figcaption>
            <p>Figure 1: An Overview of TOTO</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The complexity of TOTO originates from its system design. It is not a
stationary system that behaves the same during every draw. Instead,
its properties are determined by the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>How large is the jackpot</li>
<li>The number of people who are going to play, which is influenced by
the size of the jackpot and also influences the jackpot size</li>
<li>Is the game in &ldquo;snowball mode&rdquo;, which depends on last few games</li>
</ol>
<p>Over the course of several draws, these elements affect each other and
create a stochastic system with reflexivity. This means that we cannot
simply draw a table to calculate the EV of TOTO. Each draw will have
to have its own table.</p>
<p>A further complication arises when some information is not publicly
available. For example, it is not possible to know how many punters
will bet before a draw is closed. Hence it is not possible to know the
exact jackpot for a draw before it is closed.</p>
<p>At this point, you may ask, &ldquo;why should I care? Isn&rsquo;t it as simple as
buying when the prize is big?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The issue is that when the prize is large, there are more punters.
This is not desirable because more punters mean that the prizes will
be split, with each of them getting less. All else equal, a less
crowded bet is a more desirable bet.</p>
<p>In fact, based on the past three hundred draws, it can be observed
that number of ticket sold is approximately a quadratic function of
the jackpot, as shown below. Interestingly, a study of Powerball in
the US also show similar quadratic relationship (see Figure
3.) <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Figure 3: Powerball Ticket Sold as a Quadratic Function of Jackpot</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While such a convex relationship is bad news for punters, it does show
that number of ticket sold, and consequently, the final jackpot, is
largely predictable from publicly available information. This is
encouraging because it means that one can largely examine the states
of the system before placing a bet.</p>
<h2 id="the-snowball-and-the-cascade">The Snowball and the Cascade</h2>
<p>In its essence, snowball is the part of game rule that enable the
jackpot to accumulate beyond the current draw. Any unwon prizes in
first four prize groups accumulate to next draw. This is what create
a headline-worthy jackpot and snaking queues of punters.</p>
<p>Cascade happens when snowball ends. If the jackpot has been snowballed
three times, and still not won in the fourth time, it cascades down to
the prize group below, until won. Here the slate is wiped, jackpot is
cleared and the game becomes boring again.</p>
<p>Astute readers can see that snowball and cascade stages are probably where
money are made, if such an opportunity exists at all. The reasoning
for this is straightforward. In a draw where the jackpot is purely consisting of current sales
proceeding, all the punters in aggregate are only expected to get what
is left of their initial stake plus some<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, after the state
has taken its 8% tax<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> and Singapore Pools its 46% cut. However,
in the case of a snowball, or better, a thrice-snowballed draw on the
verge of cascading, current punters, in aggregate, have a chance or is
certain to get the above, plus money left in the pool by earlier
punters. In fact, this is the insight that enabled the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advantage%5Fgambling">advantage
players</a> to beat the Massachusetts Cash Winfall lottery. They only bet
when the prize pool is on the verge of cascading. Just like one of
those coin pushers in an arcade, it make no sense to throw in a coin when
the machine is empty, whereas the same action becomes appealing when
it is filled to the brim.</p>
<h2 id="balance-on-the-edge">Balance on the Edge</h2>
<p>So it all comes down to two opposing forces:</p>
<ol>
<li>The tendency of large number of punters when the jackpot is big</li>
<li>The tendency of large payout when the jackpot is big</li>
</ol>
<p>The answer to the question whether the game is beatable, or whether it
has positive EV given certain strategy, is hinged on whether the
system is well-designed to balance these two forces. It does not have
to be. Cash Winfall wasn&rsquo;t and the latter constantly outweighs the
former <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, giving punters an edge.</p>
<p>How can we model this advantage? One option is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte%5FCarlo%5Fmethod">simulation</a>. We can simulate
the lottery draw many times and observe its behaviors. Another, more
elegant, idea presented in Jordan Ellenberg&rsquo;s book is to consider the
all punters in a draw as one entity. Namely, without caring who
exactly won how much, we can consider how much money the punters as a
whole put in, and how much they managed to win in total. If the former
is larger than the latter, the punters lose money. And since all
tickets should have proportionally contributed to the stake, and has a
corresponding share of the expected prize, by principle of additivity,
we know that buying a ticket would be a losing bet. This second
approach reduces the variables we need to study to two - the total
stakes and the total winning. We can define a draw&rsquo;s return as the
ratio between total winning and total stake.</p>
<figure><img src="/ox-hugo/toto_return.svg"
         alt="Figure 4: TOTOal Winning as % of TOTOtal Stake"/><figcaption>
            <p>Figure 4: TOTOal Winning as % of TOTOtal Stake</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The above chart shows TOTO&rsquo;s return during the last 303 draws, since
2020 July. Several observations can be made from the chart:</p>
<ol>
<li>The return oscillates around 50%. This is inline with expectation
as the state and Singapore Pools takes 50% from each stake</li>
<li>The return has never exceeded 100%, with the highest being 79%.</li>
<li>The worst return is 22%. It happened on Draw No.3783, where nobody
won the first and second prize group.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can tabulate the return by the number of snowball accumulated<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Snowball</th>
<th>Average Return</th>
<th>N</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>38%</td>
<td>90</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>49%</td>
<td>53</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>57%</td>
<td>26</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>69%</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total</td>
<td>45%</td>
<td>178</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can conclude that while there is no positive-ev way to play TOTO,
the least bad way is only play when the jackpot has snowballed three
times. At that point the EV is almost 70%. These opportunities are
rare, occurring roughly 1 in 20 draws.</p>
<p>Returning to our original question of whether TOTO can be beaten, the
answer is no, not under the current rules and given the game&rsquo;s
popularity. This conclusion is worth reexamining if any of the two
ever changed.</p>
<p>In terms of whether the Expected Value (EV) can be improved, the answer is yes. Our
analysis shows that one should concentrate her bet on those occasions
that the jackpot has accumulated 3 times. This, sadly, does not push the
bet into profitable territory.</p>
<h2 id="festive-draws">Festive Draws</h2>
<p>An interesting exercise is to use the same framework to analyze
festive draws. In these events, Singapore Pools will announce a large
jackpot amount, which in turns will attract a huge crowd to play TOTO.
Are these good opportunities to play the lottery? Below are six such
draws:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Draw</th>
<th>Announced Jackpot <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></th>
<th>Return</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2021 Reunion Draw</td>
<td>$5M</td>
<td>34%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2021 Hongbao Draw</td>
<td>$9.6M</td>
<td>51%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2022 Hongbao Draw</td>
<td>$16M</td>
<td>57%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2022 Reunion Draw</td>
<td>$5M</td>
<td>51%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2023 Reunion Draw</td>
<td>$5M</td>
<td>48%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2023 Hongbao Draw</td>
<td>$12M</td>
<td>49%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It turns out they are not. Because of their immense publicity and
popularity, punters are actually worse off compared to playing a draw
where the jackpot has been snowballed 2 or 3 times.</p>
<h2 id="the-winners">The Winners</h2>
<p>The true winner of TOTO is Singapore Pools and the Singapore
government, based on the simple fact that roughly half of the punter&rsquo;s
stake is taken away as income (before expenses) and tax even before
the outcome is decided.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a fully-owned subsidiary of the Tote Board, all surplus generated
from Singapore Pools’ operations are channelled to our parent for the
funding of worthy causes in the arts, community development, charity,
education, health and sports sectors. Over the past 10 years, the Tote
Board Group (comprising Tote Board, Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf
Club) has contributed more than $6 billion towards nation-building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your contributions to nation-building!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>A deep dive into the world of Singapore lotteries has revealed that
none of the games, in their current form, are good bets. While 4D and
Singapore Sweep are impenetrable statistically, TOTO&rsquo;s moat is less
deterministic, but still wide. It is made up of its popularity
and balanced cascade mechanism. As long as there are so many people
playing the game as it is, punters as a whole bleed money profusely. A
worldly gambler should consult the wisdom of statistics to minimize
the damage incurred by participating such hazardous pursuit.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t make the assumption that rules do not change.
