      <title>Intellectual Escape Velocity</title>
      <link>https://plwg.github.io/intellectual-escape-velocity/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In physics, the term &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape%5Fvelocity&#34;&gt;escape velocity&lt;/a&gt; refers to &amp;ldquo;the minimum speed
needed for a free, non-propelled object to escape from the
gravitational influence of a primary body, thus reaching an infinite
distance from it&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, escape velocity is an umbrella term for so called cosmic
velocities. The first four cosmic velocities are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To escape earth&amp;rsquo;s surface and reach orbit: 7.9 km/s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; earth&amp;rsquo;s gravitational pull: 11.2 km/s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; sun&amp;rsquo;s gravitational pull: 16.7 km/s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s gravitational pull: 525 km/s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the idea of escape velocity is fascinating because it is
binary - going faster than it, you are free; going slower than it, you
are forever bound to the object pulling you. It is similar to the idea
of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticality%5F(status)&#34;&gt;criticality&lt;/a&gt; in nuclear physics, which refers to the state that,
once reached, the chain reaction can remain self-sustaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also fascinating as a model applying to the act of thinking.
Similar to an intergalactic probe flying faster than escape velocity
to evade the pull of cosmic bodies, a person aspired to think freely
cannot stay intellectually stagnant, because there exists various
school of thought that exhibit strong intellectual attraction. They
will pull one into their orbits. And once captured, unless enough
reflection was done against the prevailing wisdom, one is no longer
free. It is better to evade capture in the first place. I feel that
this characteristic explains why otherwise smart people fall under the
influence of cults. Their existing intellectual velocity was below the
necessary escape velocity. Drawn in, they end up becoming part of
those bodies, adding to their mass, and waiting to pull down the next
drifting voyager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this is why one has to think even more critically when
approaching a prominent school of thoughts (akin to apply a countering
force opposite the direction of the gravitational pull), because the
latter&amp;rsquo;s mass, both inherent and added to by those already claimed by
its gravitation, is powerful. This explains why madness of crowds
often grow at a frenzy pace as it approaches the end - it is pulling
everything into its orbit, and the resulting mass in turns more things
into its orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another phenomenon that I think the model of escape velocity applies
to is that of personal enlightenment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone at birth starts with an initial velocity of zero, but has
different innate ability when its comes to acceleration, i.e., the
ability to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upbringing/family/environment determines the escape velocity
required, i.e., how much one has to learn in order to move away
from his starting point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these, one reaches the sobering conclusion that, not everyone
will be able to go far from where he started. Some people were born
into families that pull them downward with great force; some failed to
learn; some learn, but not fast enough as the adversity is also
getting stronger; some were in an environment that simply does not
have the material to provide the acceleration. It takes all - constant
effort, aptitude and the right education - to transcend one&amp;rsquo;s
upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what it is still worthwhile to try to reach escape velocity.
Though not everyone will chart a course into infinity, perhaps it is
still viable to reach orbit, and that would be a better starting point
for the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Social Media is a Loading Spring</title>
      <link>https://plwg.github.io/social-media-is-a-loading-spring/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://plwg.github.io/social-media-is-a-loading-spring/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system is spring-loaded if it is coiled in a certain direction, positive or negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many have said that social media is an echo chamber. It comes to my
mind that a more appropriate metaphor is a spring being loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the fictional case of Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice posts an opinion on Ditto, a social media platform. Many of
Alice&amp;rsquo;s followers agree with her and start to &amp;ldquo;ditto&amp;rdquo; Alice&amp;rsquo;s post,
pushing it to their follower&amp;rsquo;s timeline. Their followers do the same.
Logically, this process will repeat and propagate itself until it
reaches an equilibrium, &lt;strong&gt;which is the point that every new person
exposed is neutral or negative about Alice&amp;rsquo;s opinion&lt;/strong&gt;. And inevitably
it will reach an end, unless Alice&amp;rsquo;s opinion happens to be a novel
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow%5FCrash&#34;&gt;neuro-lingustic virus&lt;/a&gt; that is capable of taking over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is a highly unpleasant experience for Alice. During the
&amp;ldquo;spring-loading&amp;rdquo; phase, her content spreads far and fast among
supporters. But the end result is that her opinion will eventually get
exposed to an &lt;strong&gt;as-large-as-possible&lt;/strong&gt; surface area of dislike and
ambivalence, often with size many times of her supporter. And because
an attacker can always trace back to Alice, she might suddenly found
that the wind has changed and she is facing a backlash for her
previously popular opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is not a novel observation that people face criticisms and
backlash online, I think the thing worth noting is the spring-like
nature of this phenomenon, that the public opinion will inevitably violently
recoil, and the more popular an online opinion was, the worse the
backlash in the end. Perhaps this is why people are polarized
nowadays. Perhaps Alice&amp;rsquo;s opinion should never have reached so many
disapproving eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can something be done about this? It probably requires tweaking the
algorithm of these social media platforms such that the speed a piece
of information travels is dampen and the recoil eased. Should it be
done? I don&amp;rsquo;t know. If overdone, I am afraid that it risks creating
real echo chamber where information circulates only internally.&lt;/p&gt;
